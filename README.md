## Classification of sorting algorithms

- Number of comparisons
    - At least a sorting algorithms do O(nlogn) comparisons.
- Number of swaps
- Memory usage
- Recursion
- Stability
    - Sorting algorithms are stable if for all indices i and j such that A[i] equals key A[j], if record R[i] precedes record R[j] in the original file, record R[i] precedes R[j] in the sorted list.
- Adaptability
    - With few sorting algorithms, the complexity changes based on pre-sortedness: pre-sortedness of the input effects the running time. Algorithms that takes this into account are known as adaptive.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
